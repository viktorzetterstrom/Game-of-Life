/*
Erik's RuleOfExistence, based on Conway's rule while also differentiate the appearance of cells based on their age.

Concrete Rule of existence, implementing Erik's rule.
Sentient lifeforms is rarely created, but once in a while a cell has lived enough generations to become as wise as Erik.

- Once a cell has survived a minimum amount of generations it will recieve a color to distinguish itself from younger ones.
- If such a cell would then survive another set amount of generations, it will be marked with a value of **E**.
- In the extreme case, where the cell has achieved above requirements and is determined to be the oldest living cell, it will
become a **prime elder**, and have its color changed once again. A generation may only have one such elder.
