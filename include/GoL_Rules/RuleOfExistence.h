Abstract base class, upon which concrete rules will derive.

The derivations of RuleOfExistence is what determines the culture of Cell Population. Each rule implements
specific behaviours and so may execute some parts in different orders. In order to accommodate this
requirement RuleOfExistence will utilize a **Template Method** desing pattern, where all derived rules
implements their logic based on the virtual method executeRule().
